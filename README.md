App Developed:- Upon clicking the "Nope Not Really" button, the control goes to "NewWondersViewController" that parse the Json file to fetch the names of the 7 wonders and render it in a table view. The user can click on any table cell to see the details in the next screen i.e. "WonderDetailsViewController". The "WonderDetailsViewController" displays the respective wonder object details i.e. Name, Description and the Image. The image Url is fetched from the Wonders.json and if success result (HTTP -200) encountered, the same image will be displayed in the "WonderDetailsViewController". The User can then tap on the image to "copy" the image URL . The user can click on the "Map View" to get the map view of the image with the help of the "MapViewController" . This controller displays the location of the selected wonder along with a nearby location.
